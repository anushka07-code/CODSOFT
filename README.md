This repository contains three completed tasks assigned during my internship at CODSOFT. Each task was developed using C++ and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like logic building , control structures, and user interaction via the console .

Task List :
Task 1 : NUMBER GUESSING GAME 
This program is a simple console based game where the computer generates a random number and the user attempts to guess it . After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low , and continues to prompt the user until the correct number is guessed . It demonstrates the use of loops , conditional statements , and random number generation in C++.

Task 2 : SIMPLE CALCULATOR 
In this task , I developed a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is asked to enter two numbers and select an operation to perform. The program then processes the input and displayes the result. this task helped reinforce the use of functions , switch statements , and user defined operations.

Task 3 : TIC-TAC-TOE GAME 
This project is a console-based two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3*3 grid using 'X' and 'O'. The program manages the game board, takes user input for each move, checks for win or draw conditions after every turn, and displayes the result accordingly. It also includes functionality to restart the game after completion. This task involved the application of arrays, loops, and game logic to create a fully functional interactive game. 

Technologies Used : 
Language - C++
Plateform - Console (Terminal- based execution)

How to Run the Programs :
(i) Clone the repository
Bash
git clone
https://github.com/anushka07-code/CODSOFT.git

(ii) Nevigate to the project folder
Bash
cd CODSOFT

(iii) Compile and run any task
Bash
g++ task1.cpp -o task1./task1

Replace task1.cpp with task2.cpp or task3.cpp to run other tasks .
